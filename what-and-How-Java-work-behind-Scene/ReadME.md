  <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.</p>

    <h1>Types of Java Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standalone Application:</strong>
            Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone applications are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Application:</strong>
            An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enterprise Application:</strong>
            An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc., is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mobile Application:</strong>
            An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Platform</h1>
    <p> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Java Platforms / Editions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Java SE (Java Standard Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math, etc. It covers core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is an enterprise platform mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</p>
