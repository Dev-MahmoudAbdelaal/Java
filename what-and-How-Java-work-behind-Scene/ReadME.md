    <h1>What is Java ?</h1>
    <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure
        programming language.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Types of Java Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standalone Application:</strong>
            Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are
            traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone applications are Media
            player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Application:</strong>
            An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application.
            Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web
            applications in Java.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enterprise Application:</strong>
            An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc., is called an enterprise
            application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is
            used for creating enterprise applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mobile Application:</strong>
            An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and
            Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Platform</h1>
    <p> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime
        environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Java Platforms / Editions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Java SE (Java Standard Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io,
                java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math, etc. It covers core topics like OOPs, String, Regex,
                Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection,
                etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is an enterprise platform mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top
                of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java ME (Java Micro Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is a micro platform dedicated to mobile applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>JavaFX:</strong>
            <p>It is used to develop rich internet applications. It utilizes a lightweight user interface API.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <h1>Java Terminology</h1>
    <h2>1. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h2>
    <p>This is generally referred to as JVM. There are three execution phases of a program:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li>
        <li>The compilation is done by the JAVAC compiler which is a primary Java compiler included in the Java
            development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input and generates bytecode as output.</li>
        <li>In the Running phase of a program, JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li>
        <br>
        <img
                src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200823163148/machinecode-300x162.png">
    </ul>
    <p>Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute the bytecode produced by the compiler.
        Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output they produce after the execution of bytecode is the
        same across all the operating systems. This is why Java is known as a platform-independent language.</p>
    <h2>2. Bytecode in the Development Process</h2>
    <p>As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by
        JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Java Development Kit (JDK)</h2>
    <p>JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It's a software development kit used by Java developers for building Java applications. The JDK includes a set of tools and libraries that are necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java programs. Here's a brief overview of its components:</p>
    <h3>JDK Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Compiler (javac):</strong> This is the tool used to compile Java source code files (.java) into bytecode files (.class) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> The JDK includes a complete JRE, which consists of the JVM, libraries, and other components necessary for running Java applications. This allows developers to both develop and run Java programs using the JDK.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Development Tools:</strong> The JDK includes various command-line tools and utilities for developing Java applications, such as javadoc for generating API documentation, jar for creating and managing Java archive (JAR) files, and jdb for debugging Java programs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Standard Libraries:</strong> The JDK provides a rich set of standard libraries (also known as the Java API) that developers can use to build Java applications. These libraries cover a wide range of functionality, including I/O operations, networking, GUI development, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sample Code and Documentation:</strong> The JDK includes sample code and documentation to help developers get started with Java programming and to understand how to use various features and APIs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</h2>
    <p>JDK includes JRE. JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile
        it. JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs
        JRE.</p>
    <h2>5. Garbage Collector</h2>
    <p>In Java, programmers canâ€™t delete the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called
        Garbage Collector. Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life
        of a programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their code
        whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot recover the memory of
        objects being referenced.</p>
    <h2>6. ClassPath</h2>
    <p>The classpath is the file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load. By
        default, JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the
        classpath.</p> -->
