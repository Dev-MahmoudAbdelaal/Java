  <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Types of Java Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Standalone Application:</strong>
            Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone applications are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Application:</strong>
            An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enterprise Application:</strong>
            An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc., is called an enterprise application. It has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mobile Application:</strong>
            An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Platform</h1>
    <p> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Java Platforms / Editions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Java SE (Java Standard Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math, etc. It covers core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is an enterprise platform mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java ME (Java Micro Edition):</strong>
            <p>It is a micro platform dedicated to mobile applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>JavaFX:</strong>
            <p>It is used to develop rich internet applications. It utilizes a lightweight user interface API.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>what is JDK...?</h1>
    <pre>JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It's a software development kit used by Java developers for building Java applications. The JDK includes a set of tools and libraries that are necessary for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java programs. Here are some key components of the JDK:</pre>
     <h1>JDK Components</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Compiler (javac):</strong> This is the tool used to compile Java source code files (.java) into bytecode files (.class) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> The JDK includes a complete JRE, which consists of the JVM, libraries, and other components necessary for running Java applications. This allows developers to both develop and run Java programs using the JDK.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Development Tools:</strong> The JDK includes various command-line tools and utilities for developing Java applications, such as javadoc for generating API documentation, jar for creating and managing Java archive (JAR) files, and jdb for debugging Java programs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Standard Libraries:</strong> The JDK provides a rich set of standard libraries (also known as the Java API) that developers can use to build Java applications. These libraries cover a wide range of functionality, including I/O operations, networking, GUI development, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sample Code and Documentation:</strong> The JDK includes sample code and documentation to help developers get started with Java programming and to understand how to use various features and APIs.
        </li>
    </ul>
